Let's build a project that we can use for our portfolio. Pick any API from here and make a web app that fetches data and displays it. Make sure that your page has a loader, and an error for when fetch fails. Also, make it so that you can handle pagination (fetching more if available). Add the link to the github page here :)

Feel free to schedule a pair programming session with me if you get stuck!# API Project
